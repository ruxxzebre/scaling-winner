	-- long name for quickchat menu options title
		-- short name for quickchat message sender prefix
	-- slider for secondary sphere cast radius?
	
	-- don't mark security cameras that are disabled (eg if camera operator element is neutralized)
	
	-- fix autoping detecting bodybag interaction?
		-- use can_interact()? 
			-- but that would disable other pings, eg. pinging a car, then picking up a bag, would remove the car ping, since you can't enter a car while carrying a bag
			-- case-specific solution it is i guess.
	
	-- lock/lockpick icon?
	-- grenade case icon
	
	-- just hide waypoints on enter forbidden state and show them again on enter whitelisted state
		-- don't jump through so many hoops 
		-- this would fix waypoints being visible when existing waypoints are synced upon dropping-in to game in progress

			--arrow triangle is too even
		
		--waypoint distance from player instead of camera?
		--downscale assets (48x?)
			-- i really thought 64x was the play
		
		--proximity priority for spherecast
		-- need to find a network receive solution that isn't spherecasting for the unit_id;
		-- as it stands, theoretically, a severely desynced unit might fail to be found by the receiver peer if it's outside the expected radius
			-- searching enemies list/interactions list?

	--FEATURES
		--linger time for timer waypoints
		
		--modifier key to force placement
		--modifier key to go through glass(thin walls)
		--modifier key for timers
		
		-- ping existing vanilla waypoints

		--button/keybind to remove all waypoints
			--remove all waypoints data AND all panel children
			
		--subtle light glow at waypoint area
		--feedback on waypoint placement fail
		
		-- adjust sound vector normalization
			-- based on distance?
			-- turning left/right makes the positional audio fading too extreme
			-- should probably be mostly centered unless it's offscreen (check dot?)
		
		-- don't actually show radial menu until mouse moves?
			-- assume neutral ping
			-- would need to rewrite radialmenu to not be a dialog
			--allow other movement actions during radial menu? (eg. steelsight)
				--tactical leaning compat
					--use head position instead of cam position?

		--allow raycasting teammates (ai)
		
		--display current gamepad mode in options menu
		--customization
			--custom radial messages (use QKI?)
			--preview radial in menu
			--button combos?
		--add localization chat shortcuts for things like skills or achievement names
		--localize menu button names for controllers, per gamepad type
		--allow selecting button by waiting at menu (for controllers) for x seconds
			--(this allows controllers to bind or reserve any options they desire, without interfering with menu operation)
		--remove waypoint on pinged unit death?
			--edge case where you want to keep the body marked after death is out of scope
				--in this case, players should simply re-mark the body after death
				--or i guess i could make a setting for that
			-- alternatively, waypoint can tell you something about the pinged unit? like whether it's alive or dead
		
		-- lower opacity if no LOS to waypoint?
			
	--ASSETS
		
		--autotranslate icon for pretranslated messages in chat
			-- something is wrong with the special character i'm using in the merged_font, i think
		--normal surface plane for area markers
		
	--BUGS
		--TimerManager:game():time() between client and host is desynced; use a different timer
		--QuickChat detects controller mode if a controller is plugged in, even if keyboard is the "main" input
		--character unit waypoints are in an unexpected place; move above head instead
			--probably involves differently sized waypoint panels
		--SWAT turrets have their target unit body detected incorrectly; waypoint is visually offset from the perceived turret core as a result
			-- not sure how to resolve this. it'd have to be case-specific unit->tweaktable:body lookups and i really don't wanna do that
		--known issue: discrepancies in max waypoint count between players may cause unexpected behavior
			--waypoint limits are only enforced locally, so a client with a higher count may see other players' waypoints linger
			--waypoint limit is now set at 1 globally, with no setting; consider this resolved
